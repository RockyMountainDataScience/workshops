This workshop will show you how to debug your code without print statements
and with the native debugger in your IDE (we will use VS Code for the demo).
Can you find the bug in the interpolate_polynomial() function? It is very 
subtle.

Also we will learn about using git code versioning software (there are others 
e.g. svn). Services that use git inlcude GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc. 
We will cover the following commands that are covered in detail in
https://git-scm.com/docs. 

- clone
- status
- add 
- commit [-a -m "MESSAGE"]
- push
- pull
- checkout
- log
- diff

A good place for git background is 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics

VS Code has git natively built in!
